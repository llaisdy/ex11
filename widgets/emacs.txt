   swEmacs is a microscopic implementation of "Emacs in a box"

   The following keys work

   ^A = Beginning of line
   ^E = End of line
   ^D = Delete character in front of cursor
   ^B = Backwards character
   ^F = Forwards character

   PgUp and PgDown scoll the buffer.

   The arrow keys do what they are supposed to.

   Character insertions and deletions work as they are supposed to.

   Resizeing the window is currently broken (so don't try to do this)

   To create a text editor

      Emacs = swEmacs:make(Win, X, Y, Width, Ht, 1, ?white),

   Width and Height are in units of characters

   Then do

      Emacs ! {edit, F}

   To edit the file F
