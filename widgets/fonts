%%  Some of  the multi-part names are  quite long. These  names follow a
%%  standard called X Logical Font Description, or XLFD.
%%
%%  Each part  of an XLFD name  is separated by  a hyphen. If a  part is
%%  missing,  you'll  see  two  hyphens  in  a row.  You  can  also  use
%%  wildcards, such as * for fields you don't care about.
