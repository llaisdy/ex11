  Outstanding problems

  1) How can I kill the top level window from within the program ?
My forms example works - BUT evey time I kill the sever mozilla opens up
a page to redhat ????

  2) How can  I interact  with the window  manager itself? -  I'd like
change the text in the window title. etc.
