** todo

- Makefiles are hard coded for my FreeBSD setup.  Factor out the BSD/Linux platform-specifics

*** Original Todo:

1) Fix GC's so they are allocated and de_allocated per-window

2) Fix hello etc in the lib dir

3) piff up documentation

4) grep after XXXX for frej's comments

Do I want to open windows on different screens on the same display??

Why should I ever want to do this?

I only ever open things on the default display (as set in the DISPLAY variable)
