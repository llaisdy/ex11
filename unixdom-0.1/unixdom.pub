{abstract,"This is an incomplete implementation of a UNIX-domain
socket driver for the Erlang VM.  It was originally written while
I was at Sendmail, Inc.  All of the major functions work, though
the timeout-handling code is probably flaky.  Under Solaris/SPARC,
we saw roughly a 10% improvement in bulk data throughput using
this driver versus using TCP across the loopback interface."}.
